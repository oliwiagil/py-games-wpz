# battleships4d - ≈Åukasz Dobrzycki - 4-dimensional version of the battleships game with a graphical interface. <br /><br />

About the rules and the goal of the game: <br />
The player has two 5 x 5 x 5 x 5 boards. (4 spatial dimensions.) One for their own ships, the second one for noting the effects of shooting at the board of the oponent. A ship is defined in this game as a group of neighboring cells (Von Neumann neighborhood of range 1) of the type: FUNCTIONAL/DAMAGED, or in the case of a sunken ship - DEAD. The ships should have their size set to no less than 4. Smaller ships lead to very long and boring games. The ships can have any shape, provided that we can access each of its cells from any other of its cells by traversing the space by changing one of the coordinates by one at a time and that every cell on our way there also belongs to the same ship. Every ship is surrounded by an "exclusion zone". It's a space where no other ship can exist. (A cell can not be a part of a ship if there is a cell belonging to another ship present in a distance 1 in the maximum metric from it.) The goal of the game is to sink all of the enemy ships. <br />

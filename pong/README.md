# **PONG**
I am a simple implementation of pong game made with Tkinter.

## **How to use me**
To start the game simply choose me from manager window.
The goal of the game is to bounce the ball as long as possible before it would touch the ground level. After the end of each game player is asked if he wants to play again - it can be confirmed by pressing enter.
Score in form of time in seconds is stored in file after each game.
